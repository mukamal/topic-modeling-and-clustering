# topic-modeling-and-clustering


The Syracuse iSchool is an interdisciplinary research community. Our faculty members
conducted research on various topics. A challenge for our school is how to present our
diversified research in an organized way. You are invited to help solve this problem by applying
document clustering and topic modeling algorithms to the faculty publications, in order to
discover the main topics in faculty research, and to group professors by similar research interest.
Your findings will be summarized and presented to the iSchool research committee.
